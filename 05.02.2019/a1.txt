1.Understand the working flow of the AODV protocol implemented in ns2 and try to answer the following questions :

a) How to enable HELLO packets in AODV ? Name the file in which you can do it.

A: For enabling HELLO packets we need to make changes in AODV.cc file. 

In the following segment of code:

//#ifndef AODV_LINK_LAYER_DETECTION
      htimer.handle((Event*) 0);
      ntimer.handle((Event*) 0);
//#endif // LINK LAYER DETECTION

the first and fourth lines are commented. In this way HELLO packets will be enabled.


Therefore that segment of code becomes:

//#ifndef AODV_LINK_LAYER_DETECTION
      htimer.handle((Event*) 0);
      ntimer.handle((Event*) 0);
//#endif // LINK LAYER DETECTION


b) What are the timers used in AODV protocol? What is the use of timer?

A: The timers used in AODV are as follows:
1)Broadcast Timer: This timer is responsible for purging the IDâ€™s of Nodes
and schedule after every BCAST_ID_SAVE.
2)Hello Timer: It is responsible for sending of Hello Packets with a delay
value equal to interval, where
double interval = MinHelloInterval + ((MaxHelloInterval - MinHelloInt-
erval) * Random::uniform());
3)Neighbor Timer: Purges all timed-out neighbor entries and schedule after
every HELLO INTERVAL .
4)RouteCache Timer: This timer is responsible for purging the route from
the routing table and schedule after every FREQUENCY.
5)Local Repair Timer: This timer is responsible for repairing the routes.

Timers are used to delay actions or can also be used for the repetition of
a particular action like broadcasting of Hello packets after fixed time interval.


c)Name the function in ns2 which gets executed in Network layer of AODV when receiving a packet by any node? Name the file in which this function is present?

A: The function is 
void recv(Packet *p, Handler *)

It is present in the aodv.cc file.

d) Name the function used in ns2 for AODV to update the route? Mention the filename where the function is present?
A: The function is
void rt_update(aodv rt entry *rt, u int32 t seqnum,u int16 t metric, nsaddr t nexthop,double expire time)

It is present in the aodv.cc file.

e) Which function is invoked whenever the link layer reports a route failure? Name the filename also.
A: The function is
void rt_ll_failed(Packet *p)

It is present in the aodv.cc file.


f) What is local repair in a protocol? Name the local repair function for AODV in ns2? Name the .cc file.

A: The function is
void local_rt_repair(aodv rt entry *rt, Packet *p)

The file is aodv.cc


g) Which function is responsible for handling link failure? Name the .cc file.
A: The function is
void handle_link_failure(nsaddr t id)

The file is aodv.cc


h) Which function is responsible for purging the routing table entries from the routing table? Name the .cc file.
A: The function is 
void rt_purge(void)

The file is aodv.cc
